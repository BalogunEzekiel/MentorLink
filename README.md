# 🎯 MentorLink App – A Mentorship Matching Platform

## 📌 Project Description

MentorLink is a web-based platform built to bridge the mentorship gap in the tech ecosystem, particularly within the **Digital SkillUp Africa (DSA)** community by **The Incubator Hub**. It offers personalized mentor-mentee matching based on shared interests, skills, career goals and availability. The platform ensures a smooth onboarding experience, communication channel and structured mentoring progress tracking.

## 🚧 Problem Statement

Aspiring developers often face difficulties in finding accessible, experienced mentors whose goals and schedules align with theirs. Traditional mentor-matching methods are typically manual, unstructured and inefficient—leading to mismatched or failed mentorship relationships. MentorLink addresses this gap by automating the process and optimizing mentor-mentee compatibility.
